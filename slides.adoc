=== Subset and superset of C++

image::images/CppCoreGuidelinesGSL.jpg[]

=== Core Guidelines Profiles

a set of deterministic and portably enforceable subset of rules (i.e., restrictions) that are designed to achieve a specific guarantee. “Deterministic” means they require only local analysis and could be implemented in a compiler (though they don’t need to be). “Portably enforceable” means they are like language rules, so programmers can count on different enforcement tools giving the same answer for the same code.

Conforming code is considered to be safe by construction with regard to the safety properties targeted by that profile. Conforming code will not be the root cause of errors for that property, although such errors might be introduced into a program by other code, libraries or the external environment.


=== Safety Profiles
Current profiles include:

=== Type safety

For the purposes of this section, type-safety is defined to be the property that a variable is not used in a way that doesn’t obey the rules for the type of its definition. Memory accessed as a type T should not be valid memory that actually contains an object of an unrelated type U. Note that the safety is intended to be complete when combined also with Bounds safety and Lifetime safety.

=== Type safety profile summary:

    Type.1: Avoid casts:
        Don’t use reinterpret_cast; 
        A strict version of Avoid casts and prefer named casts.
        Don’t use static_cast for arithmetic types; 
        A strict version of Avoid casts and prefer named casts.
        Don’t cast between pointer types where the source type and the target type are the same; 
        A strict version of Avoid casts.
        Don’t cast between pointer types when the conversion could be implicit; 
        A strict version of Avoid casts.
    Type.2: Don’t use static_cast to downcast: Use dynamic_cast instead.
    Type.3: Don’t use const_cast to cast away const (i.e., at all): Don’t cast away const.
    Type.4: Don’t use C-style (T)expression or functional T(expression) casts: Prefer construction or named casts or T{expression}.
    Type.5: Don’t use a variable before it has been initialized: always initialize.
    Type.6: Always initialize a data member: always initialize, possibly using default constructors or default member initializers.
    Type.7: Avoid naked union: Use variant instead.
    Type.8: Avoid varargs: Don’t use va_arg arguments.


=== Bounds safety

We define bounds-safety to be the property that a program does not use an object to access memory outside of the range that was allocated for it. Bounds safety is intended to be complete only when combined with Type safety and Lifetime safety, which cover other unsafe operations that allow bounds violations.

=== Bounds safety profile summary:

* Bounds.1: Don’t use pointer arithmetic. 
Use span instead: Pass pointers to single objects (only) and Keep pointer arithmetic simple.
* Bounds.2: Only index into arrays using constant expressions: Pass pointers to single objects (only) and Keep pointer arithmetic simple.
* Bounds.3: No array-to-pointer decay: Pass pointers to single objects (only) and Keep pointer arithmetic simple.
* Bounds.4: Don’t use standard-library functions and types that are not bounds-checked: Use the standard library in a type-safe manner.

=== Lifetime safety

Accessing through a pointer that doesn’t point to anything is a major source of errors, and very hard to avoid in many traditional C or C++ styles of programming. For example, a pointer might be uninitialized, the nullptr, point beyond the range of an array, or to a deleted object.

=== Lifetime safety profile summary:

* Lifetime.1: Don’t dereference a possibly invalid pointer: detect or avoid.

There is a lot under the covers here. 
TODO see lifetime checkers



=== Avoid casting

Especially avoid C-style casts

[source, c++]
----
// C style casts can perform many types of casts
(uint16_t) long_data; // C-style cast
uint16_t (long_data); // C-style cast

// C++ style casts are more specific and limited
static_cast<uint16_t>(long_data); // C++ style cast
const_cast<uint16_t>(long_data); // C++ style cast
reinterpret_cast<uint16_t>(long_data); // C++ style cast
----

=== Variants over Unions

[source, c++]
----
// Variants
std::variant<int, float> data;
data = 42;
int value = std::get<int>(data);
----

=== Ownership, shared_ptr 
shared_ptr is a shared ownership smart pointer that provides the following features:

- **Reference Counting**: When a `shared_ptr` is copied or assigned, the internal reference count is incremented. When a `shared_ptr` is destroyed (e.g., goes out of scope) or reset to point to a different object, the reference count is decremented.
- **Automatic Resource Management**: The object pointed to is automatically destroyed when the reference count becomes zero, ensuring no memory leaks.
- **Pass By Value**: Passing a `shared_ptr` by value to functions is safe in terms of memory management, but it increases the reference count temporarily.
- **Thread Safety**: Operations on the reference count are thread-safe, but the object itself is not protected against concurrent access.

Example from the excerpt:
```cpp
{
  std::shared_ptr<CoolThing> ptrToThing(new CoolThing()); // Reference = 1
  {
    std::shared_ptr<CoolThing> secondPtrToThing = ptrToThing; // Reference count = 2
    passByValueFunction(secondPtrToThing); // Temporarily increases reference count
    // Reference count drops back to 2 after function call
  }
  // secondPtrToThing is destroyed, reference count = 1
}
// ptrToThing is destroyed, reference count = 0, CoolThing is deleted
```

This mechanism helps manage dynamic memory and resource allocation more safely and conveniently, reducing the risk of memory leaks and dangling pointers.

=== Ownership, shared_ptr example


[source, c++]
----
// Declared elsewhere...
void passByValueFunction(std::shared_ptr<CoolThing> thing);

//  A scope block
{
  std::shared_ptr<CoolThing> ptrToThing(new CoolThing());
  // Reference = 1
  {
    std::shared_ptr<CoolThing> secondPtrToThing = ptrToThing;
    // Reference count = 2
    passByValueFunction(secondPtrToThing);
    // This function call copies the argument, 
    // which results in reference = 3 for the duration
    // of the function call, then drops to 2 when the
    // function returns and the copy is destroyed.
  }
  // secondPtrToThing is destroyed upon leaving the scope,
  // and the reference count is now 1.
}
// Upon leaving scope, ptrToThing is destroyed, and
// the reference count = 0, triggering deletion of CoolThing.
----

=== Ownership, unique_ptr

An exclusive ownership smart pointer that provides the following features:

- **Exclusive Ownership**: A `unique_ptr` has sole ownership of the object it points to. This exclusivity ensures that only one `unique_ptr` can point to the object at any time.
- **Automatic Resource Management**: When a `unique_ptr` goes out of scope, the destructor for the object it owns is called, and the associated memory is freed. This automatic management helps prevent memory leaks.
- **Non-Copyable**: `unique_ptr` cannot be copied to ensure exclusive ownership, but it can be moved to transfer ownership from one `unique_ptr` to another using `std::move`.
- **Custom Deleters**: It supports custom deleters, allowing the user to specify how the object should be destroyed, which is useful for resources that require more than just `delete`, such as file handles or network sockets.


=== Ownership, unique_ptr example

[source, c++]
----

{
    std::unique_ptr<MyClass> myUniquePtr = std::make_unique<MyClass>();
    myUniquePtr->doSomething();

    // Transfer ownership
    std::unique_ptr<MyClass> anotherUniquePtr = std::move(myUniquePtr);
    // Now, myUniquePtr is null, and anotherUniquePtr owns the object.
}
// The MyClass is automatically destroyed when anotherUniquePtr goes out of scope.
----


=== Lifetimes

http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#SS-lifetime
Design spec https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/docs/Lifetime.pdf


    Use RAII to avoid lifetime problems.
    Use unique_ptr to avoid lifetime problems.
    Use shared_ptr to avoid lifetime problems.
    Use references when nullptr isn’t a possibility.
    Use not_null to catch unexpected nullptr early.
    Use the bounds profile to avoid range errors.

=== Span over raw arrays
[source, c++]
----
int array[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
gsl::span<int, 5> s(array);

for(int i : s) {
    std::cout << i << std::endl;
}

== Adopting Safe C++

What's adoption look like?

* Use smart pointers over raw pointers (ownership built-in)
* Use span over raw arrays
* Use variants over unions
* Avoid type conversion, and use C++ style casts when necessary

=== Easy way

clang-tidy provides cppcoreguidelines-* checks to enforce these rules

image::images/CppStandards.jpg[]

== Safe C++ Static Analysis

* clang-tidy provides cppcoreguidelines-* checks to enforce these rules
* MISRA C++ 2023 also incorporates these rules and static analysis tools like LDRA and Polyspace can will enforce these rules once they support the new standard
