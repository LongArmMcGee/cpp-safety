# Safer C++

This repository contains a presentation which relies on a voice track.

The slides alone should be sufficient to help a reader understand the broader conversation around memory safety, why it's worth improving the safety of C++, what the Safety Profiles are, what the Guidelines Support Library is, and how to leverage them to develop safer C++ system.
